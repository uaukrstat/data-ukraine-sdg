SDG_INDICATOR: 2.5.1 Indicator. Share of land returned to cultivation in the total area of land unavailable as of June 2024, percent (SDG indicator 2.5.1)

REC_USE_LIM: '1 Data will be provided starting in 2025.
The Program for compensation of costs for humanitarian demining of agricultural lands in accordance with the Procedure for using funds provided for in the state budget for compensation of costs for humanitarian demining of agricultural lands, approved by the Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine dated March 12, 2024 No. 284 (as amended), at the expense of the budget funds of the general fund of the state budget under the program KPKVK 1201420 "Compensation of costs for humanitarian demining of agricultural lands" was actually launched in the second half of 2024.
The compensation mechanism defined by this Procedure provides for a number of lengthy procedures (processing applications for compensation, conducting tender procedures, concluding contracts, carrying out work, and obtaining certificates of transfer of responsibility for the cleared area or letters of guarantee for the area released based on the results of a non-technical survey).
In this regard, data on this indicator for 2024 will not be objective, since receipt of certificates of transfer of responsibility for the cleared territory or letters of guarantee for the territory released according to the results of a non-technical survey under contracts concluded in 2024 is mostly carried out in 2025.
The Ministry of Economy calculates data only with the "Ukraine" section.
It is impossible to calculate data in the "by reasons" section, taking into account the specifics of the demining process (humanitarian demining). This process takes place in accordance with the requirements specified by the State standards of Ukraine in this area, which stipulate that the final stage of the demining process is obtaining certificates of transfer of responsibility for the cleared territory or letters of guarantee for the territory released according to the results of a non-technical survey – accordingly, such lands are considered safe.
Thus, the calculation of the indicator "share of land returned to cultivation in the total area of land unavailable as of June 2024, percent" uses data on the area of ​​exclusively demined land returned to cultivation, for which certificates of transfer of responsibility for the cleared territory or letters of guarantee for the territory liberated according to the results of a non-technical survey have been received, therefore the specified indicator can only be provided in general (without distribution by reasons).'
