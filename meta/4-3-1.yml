REC_USE_LIM: '1 Due to the military aggression of the russian federation against Ukraine in 2018 and 2021, the study was not conducted in the temporarily occupied territory of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, the city of Sevastopol and part of the temporarily occupied territories in Donetsk and Luhansk regions. 2 Due to the full-scale russian invasion of Ukraine in 2024, the study was not conducted in Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhya, Kharkiv, and Kherson regions, the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, and the city of Sevastopol. This resulted in an objective change in the territorial coverage of the sample compared to previous cycles. At the same time, the results of the previous stages of the study showed that the participation of pupils from these regions did not significantly affect the overall average result for the country in any subject. In particular, a comparison of the overall average scores with scores excluding the five indicated regions showed the absence of statistically significant differences (according to the results of the t-test for independent samples). Therefore, even in their absence, the sample retains its representativeness at the national level. 3 The Order of the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine dated April 24, 2023 No. 473 approved the Program for Nationwide External Monitoring of the Quality of Primary Education. This document expanded the list of competencies covered by monitoring: natural science competence was added to reading and mathematical competence.
In 2018 and 2021, the subject of the study was only reading and mathematical competence of primary school graduates, in accordance with the following programs:
the Program of the first stage of the national monitoring study of the quality of primary education "The state of formation of reading and mathematical competences of primary school graduates of general educational institutions", approved by the Order of the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine dated December 29, 2016 No. 1693 (as amended by the Order dated March 27, 2017 No. 470);
the Program of nationwide external monitoring of the quality of primary education "The state of formation of reading and mathematical competences of primary school graduates of general secondary educational institutions", approved by Order of the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine dated November 26, 2020 No. 1478. 
Data on the level of development of natural science competencies of primary school graduates was first collected in 2024. 4 As part of the Nationwide external monitoring of the quality of primary education in 2018 and 2021, a generalization of the types of educational institutions was carried out according to the following categories: the category "General secondary educational institutions" includes general secondary educational institutions themselves, as well as educational complexes (associations); the category "Gymnasiums / lyceums" includes gymnasiums and lyceums; the category "Specialized schools" includes specialized schools.
In the process of implementing the reform of the general secondary education system, which is provided for by the laws of Ukraine "On Education" (2017) and "On Complete General Secondary Education" (2020), the typology of educational institutions was changed in 2024. In particular, according to the new structure, general secondary educational institutions are divided into primary school (grades 1–4), gymnasium (grades 5–9) and lyceum (grades 10–12). In this regard, a significant number of institutions that in 2018 and 2021 had the type of "general secondary educational institution" acquired a new status in 2024 – "gymnasium" or "lyceum". This makes it impossible to directly compare data for 2018, 2021 and 2024 by type of educational institutions, since this is not only a change in name, but also institutional changes. As part of the Nationwide external monitoring of the quality of primary education in 2024, the types of educational institutions were summarized according to the following categories: the category "General secondary educational institutions" includes general secondary educational institutions themselves, as well as educational complexes (associations); the category "Gymnasiums / lyceums" includes gymnasiums and lyceums; the category "Specialized schools" includes specialized schools, as well as primary schools.'
